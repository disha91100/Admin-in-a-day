# Governance for Power platform

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will step into the role of a Power Platform administrator for Fabrikam and Contoso, gaining end-to-end experience in governance, monitoring, and deployment. You’ll begin by inventorying existing Power Apps and flows, then leverage the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit to track usage and enforce data policies. Next, you’ll build a Microsoft Form–based request workflow with Power Automate approvals to provision new environments and Dataverse databases on demand. You’ll explore managed environments and pipelines to promote solutions from development through test and production stages. Finally, you’ll practice app auditing and learn how to create and publish a Power App within Microsoft Teams, extending it both inside and outside your team.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Securing your Tenant**: In this hands-on lab, participants will assume the role of a Power Platform environment administrator for Fabrikam, discover and inventory existing Power Apps and flows in their tenant, and establish baseline data loss prevention and security policies. They will configure administrative connectors and governance tools to enforce these policies, ensuring users can continue building productive solutions while adhering to Fabrikam’s compliance requirements.

- **Reporting and Telemetry**: In this hands-on lab, participants will learn how to use the Power Platform admin tools and the CoE Starter Kit to explore analytics, configure Dataverse logging, and set up inventory components, gaining experience in monitoring usage and strengthening governance.

- **Action through Automation**: In this hands-on lab, participants will gain hands‑on experience automating Power Platform environment requests by building a Microsoft Form–based submission process and configuring a Power Automate approval flow to provision new environments and Dataverse databases upon admin approval. They will also explore the CoE Starter Kit’s auditing and user‑onboarding components to enforce governance and welcome new app makers into approved environments.

- **Managed Environments**: In this hands-on lab, participants will gain hands-on experience applying governance controls using Managed Environments and deploying solutions across environments using Power Platform Pipelines, enabling structured Dev > Test > Prod app lifecycle management.

- **Power Apps in Teams**: In this hands-on lab, participants will learn how to create a team in Microsoft Teams and build a Power App within it, gaining experience in app creation, publishing, and sharing for broader organizational use.

- **Explore the CoE Starter Kit (Optional)**: In this hands-on lab, participants will explore the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit to understand how it supports governance and adoption of the Power Platform. They will learn to navigate the CoE dashboard, track connector usage, review audit logs, and apply compliance processes, gaining practical experience in managing and governing app usage within an organization.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Power Platform admin center and Microsoft Teams.
- Basic understanding of Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.
- General knowledge of environment management, data governance, and DLP (Data Loss Prevention) policies.


## Architecture 

This architecture diagram explores the Power Platform ecosystem and its governance using the Power Platform Admin Center. We learned how to plan environments, apply Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, and assign security roles to ensure apps and flows remain secure and compliant. With Power Apps inside Teams, we created custom apps tailored for team needs, showing how quickly solutions can be built without heavy coding. Using Power Automate, we understood how flows connect services to automate repetitive business processes, enhancing productivity. To monitor usage, we published and used Power BI reports to analyze app and flow activities, check connector tiers, and track who is using connectors like Office 365 Outlook. Altogether, the lab showed how to combine productivity, automation, and governance in a secure and efficient way.

### Explaination of components

- **Power Platform Admin Center** – This is the main management hub for the Power Platform. From here, admins can create and manage environments, set up Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, monitor usage, and configure user roles. It ensures apps and flows are governed properly.

- **Power Apps**: A low-code/no-code tool that lets you build custom business applications quickly. You can design apps that connect to data sources, automate tasks, and run inside Microsoft Teams or standalone, helping teams solve problems without heavy coding.

- **Power Automate** :  A service that automates workflows between apps and services. It reduces manual work by creating “flows” that trigger actions automatically (e.g., send an email when a new record is added).

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: A policy feature that controls how data can move between connectors. It prevents sensitive information from being shared outside allowed services, ensuring compliance and security.

- **Security Roles**: Define permissions for users. With roles, you control who can view, edit, or manage apps and flows, keeping access restricted and safe.

- **Microsoft Teams** : A collaboration and communication platform that integrates chat, meetings, file sharing, and apps in one place.
